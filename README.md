# Simulation-of-CP-M-file-system

The goal of this project is to design and implement a simple file system called cpmFS
(i.e., CP/M file sytem). Through the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s, CP/M (Control
Program for Microcomputers) – a disk-based operating system – had dominated its era
as much as MS-DOS and later Windows dominated the IBM PC world [1]. CP/M is clearly
not the last word in advanced file systems, but it is simple, fast, and can be
implemented by a competent programmer in less than a week [2].

Example usage: 
  $ make
  $ ./cpmRun
